# ros2_rust_workspace
A template for developing ROS2 applications in Rust using VSCode as IDE inside of a Docker container

I was heavily inspired by Allison Thackston's (@athackst)
[vscode_ros2_workspace](https://github.com/athackst/vscode_ros2_workspace),
so please check out that project and give it a star or two :).

## How to use

You should already have Docker and VSCode with the remote containers plugin installed on your system.

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [vscode remote containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
